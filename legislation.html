                   <p class="summary">In 1950s-1970s, the new expressways,interstate 277, 77, 85, sliced right through historically Black areas close to Uptown,
                   displacing hundreds of households and businesses. Commercial acttivitties in those neighborhoods paused.
                   Property values next to the highways plunged. This caused the city leaders to sell Biddleville Elementary, an all-black school
                   in 1966, to make way for the Northwest Expressway, causing great impact in there Education. In Washington Heights, the average 
                   sale price of a home in 2013 was $50,250, compared to the county-wide average of $267,916. By 2015, the most recent year for 
                   which data are available, the average sale price of those homes fell to $32,500, while county-wide it rose to $273,064.</p>

                   <p class="summary">Biddleville is the oldest surviving historic African American neighborhood in the city. In 2000, 96% of Biddleville's population 
                   was African American. In 2016, the whit population had incresead to 25%. Today, Biddleville is home to new modern townhomes 
                   development that have replaced historic residentials buildings that don't appear to respect the neighborhood's historic sense of place.
                   Biddleville residents desired revitalization but not the displacemennt witnessed in similar historic African American neighborhoods 
                   in Uptown Charlotte. Growth can be good but we believe it is best when it doesn't dislpace the historic cultural landscape.</p>

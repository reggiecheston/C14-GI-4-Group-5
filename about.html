    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>Here at Back The Block we believe that every community, regardless of its economic or social status, deserves the opportunity to thrive while preserving its cultural heritage.
         Our dedicated team of advocates work hard to raise awareness about the impact of gentrification on vulnerable neighborhoods and empower local residents to actively participate in shaping their own destiny.</p>

        <h2>Idk I'll Figure It Out</h2>
        <p>While the aim of gentrification in the Charlotte, NC area may be to foster economic development by attracting businesses and opportunities, it often results in the displacement of lower-income residents, erodes the distinctive character and cultural essence of a community, 
        and exacerbates issues of inequality. This phenomenon is observable in our own neighborhoods, such as areas like Noda.</p>
